    headline: Physics of Time
    body: |
      Time in physics is defined by its measurement: time is what a clock reads.
      In classical, non-relativistic physics it is a scalar quantity and, like length,
      mass, and charge, is usually described as a fundamental quantity. Time can be
      combined mathematically with other physical quantities to derive other concepts
      such as motion, kinetic energy and time-dependent fields. Timekeeping is a
      complex of technological and scientific issues, and part of the foundation
      of recordkeeping.

    headline: Illusion of Time
    body: |
      Time is merely a perspective, rather than a universal truth. It's a point
      of view that humans share as a result of our biology and evolution,
      our place on Earth, and the planet's place in the universe.

      “From our perspective, the perspective of creatures who make up a small part
      of the world—we see that world flowing in time.” At the quantum level, however,
      durations are so short that they can't be divided and there is no such thing as time.

    headline: 'Time Travel: Theories, Paradoxes & Possibilities'
    body: |
      Time travel — moving between different points in time — has been a popular
      topic for science fiction for decades. Franchises ranging from "Doctor Who"
      to "Star Trek" to "Back to the Future" have seen humans get in a vehicle
      of some sort and arrive in the past or future, ready to take on
      new adventures. Each come with their own time travel theories.

      The reality, however, is more muddled. Not all scientists believe that
      time travel is possible. Some even say that an attempt would be fatal
      to any human who chooses to undertake it.

    headline: Quantum Theory of Time
    body: |
      One of the weirder aspects of quantum mechanics could be explained by
      an equally weird idea – that causation can run backwards in time
      as well as forwards.

      What Einstein called "spooky" action at a distance could theoretically
      be evidence of retrocausality, which is the particle equivalent of you
      getting a stomach ache today thanks to tomorrow's bad lunch.

    headline: A/B theory of time
    body: |
      The A-theory of time is typically associated with the idea that the present
      is metaphysically privileged or singled out in some way from past and future times.

      The B-theory of time, in contrast, denies that the present is metaphysically
      privileged over past and future times.

    headline: Ultimate Theory of Time
    body: |
      Time moves forward, not backward—everyone knows you can't unscramble an egg.
      That simple fact of breakfast becomes a doorway to understanding the
      Big Bang, the universe, and other universes, too. The arrow of time,
      pointing resolutely from the past to the future, owes its existence to
      conditions before the Big Bang itself — a period modern cosmology of
      which Einstein never dreamed. Increasingly, though, physicists are
      going out into realms that make the theory of relativity seem like child's play.

    headline: Basic Probability Theory
    body: |
      Probability quantifies as a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking,
      0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty. The higher the probability
      of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. A simple example
      is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes
      ("heads" and "tails") are both equally probable; the probability of "heads" equals
      the probability of "tails"; and since no other outcomes are possible, the
      probability of either "heads" or "tails" is 1/2
      (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%).

    headline: Basic Chaos theory
    body: |
      Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics focusing on the behavior of
      dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Chaos theory
      is an interdisciplinary theory stating that, within the apparent randomness of
      chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, constant feedback loops,
      repetition, self-similarity, fractals, and self-organization. The butterfly
      effect describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear
      system can result in large differences in a later state, meaning there is
      sensitive dependence on initial conditions. A metaphor for this behavior is
      that a butterfly flapping its wings in China can cause a hurricane in Texas.

      nscan ("Network Scanner") is a free and open source utility for network discovery
      and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful
      for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and
      monitoring host or service uptime. nscan uses raw IP packets in novel ways to
      determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
      name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
      (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are
      in use, and dozens of other characteristics.

    body: |
      A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work
      as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial
      transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the
      transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed
      to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.
