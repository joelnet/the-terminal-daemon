    headline: Basic Probability Theory
    body: |
      Probability quantifies as a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking,
      0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty. The higher the probability
      of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. A simple example
      is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes
      ("heads" and "tails") are both equally probable; the probability of "heads" equals
      the probability of "tails"; and since no other outcomes are possible, the
      probability of either "heads" or "tails" is 1/2
      (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%).

    headline: Basic Chaos theory
    body: |
      Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics focusing on the behavior of
      dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Chaos theory
      is an interdisciplinary theory stating that, within the apparent randomness of
      chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, constant feedback loops,
      repetition, self-similarity, fractals, and self-organization. The butterfly
      effect describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear
      system can result in large differences in a later state, meaning there is
      sensitive dependence on initial conditions. A metaphor for this behavior is
      that a butterfly flapping its wings in China can cause a hurricane in Texas.

    headline: nscan
    body: |
      nscan ("Network Scanner") is a free and open source utility for network discovery
      and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful
      for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and
      monitoring host or service uptime. nscan uses raw IP packets in novel ways to
      determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
      name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
      (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are
      in use, and dozens of other characteristics.

    headline: Introduction to Cryptocurrency
    body: |
      A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work
      as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial
      transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the
      transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed
      to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.

      Congratulations!

      You can follow simple instructions. I had my doubts.

      You must prove to us you are capable, trustworty, and above all else, loyal.

      But right now you don't know shit.

      So learn a few things and maybe we'll be in contact again.

      You are a quick learner. But learning and doing are two separate things.

      Use {cyan.bold nscan} to find vulnerable computers with known exploits.

      Start scanning, see what you can find.

      Hey, You found your first exploitable server. Congrats!

      No, seriously... Be proud, most people don't make it this far!

      At any time you can view all the servers under your control
      by running the command:

        $ {bold.cyan cat ~/servers}

      It's time to get paid. So start learning about crypto-currencies.

      Hacking servers and getting paid. This is our bread and butter.

      Hack one of your servers.

        $ {cyan.bold cat ~/servers}
        $ {cyan.bold xssh <server>}

      Install the {cyan.bold coind} daemon and start it and get out.

        $ {cyan.bold pkg install coind}
        $ {cyan.bold coind start}

      Install a {cyan.bold wallet} to hold your {cyan.bold coin}.

      Use the {cyan.bold wallet} to {cyan.bold collect} your {cyan.bold coin}
      and view your {cyan.bold balance}.

        $ {cyan.bold pkg install wallet}
