# Accessing The Terminal

To access The Terminal, you will need to have `node.js` and an up to date version of `npm`, which includes the `npx` command.

Then run the command:

```bash
# Start The Terminal
npx the-terminal
```

Note: Windows users with a space in their username may run into problems. Try this if you have problems:

```bash
# fix for Windows issues
npm i -g the-terminal

# Start The Terminal
npx the-terminal
```

Follow the directions in *Create an Account* to start playing

# Create an Account

The security for the `root` account has recently been compromised by a security patch.

Quickly, before it re-secured, log into the `root` account using the password `admin123`.

```bash
Login as: root
root's password: admin123
```

Once you've signed into the `root` account, you will have access to create a user.

```bash
# Create an Account
root$ adduser <your-username>
```

Follow the prompts and then `exit`.

```bash
# exit The Terminal
exit
```

Log back into The Terminal using your newly created credentials.

```bash
npx the-terminal
Login as: <your-username>
<your-username>'s password: <your-password>
```

You will have an email waiting for you with further instructions.

```bash
# read your mail

```

This box will serve as your entry point into The Network.
