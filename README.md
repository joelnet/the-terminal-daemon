# The Terminal

The Terminal is a hacker game played in the terminal.

# Accessing The Terminal

To access The Terminal, you will need to have `node.js` and an up to date version of `npm`, which includes the `npx` command.

Then run the command:

```bash
# Start The Terminal
npx the-terminal
```

# Create an Account

The security for the `root` account has recently been comprimised by a security patch.

Quickly, before it re-secured, log into the `root` account using the password `admin123`.

Once you've signed into the `root` account, you will have access to create a user.

```bash
# Create an Account
adduser <username>
```

Follow the prompts and then exit.

```bash
# exit The Terminnal
exit
```

Log back into The Terminal using your newly created credentials.

You will have an email waiting for you with further instructions.

```bash
# read your mail
mail
```

This box will serve as your entrypoint into The Network.
